    title: "The difference between CODER, PROGRAMMER, and DEVELOPER?",
    img: coder,
    description: `People often use three terms: "Developer," "Programmer," and "Coder" to refer to individuals working in the software development industry. But have we ever wondered how they differ? And how do we distinguish between these titles: Developer, Programmer, or Coder?

    Below is the answer, let's explore with Hybrid Technologies:`,

      `1. Coder - 
      <img src="https://jobs.hybrid-technologies.vn/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CODER.png" alt="" width="300" height="300">
      If you have a clear problem and a clear solution described in natural language or pseudocode, you need a <strong>Coder</strong> to translate them into machine language (Just code).
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>Coder</strong> – (or coder), when tasked with coding a program, often needs to be accompanied by a detailed program description, proficient in writing code, writing quickly and making the program run correctly as described, but in most cases, the product is not very tidy when looking into the code.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Anyone who writes code is often called a coder by non-tech savvy individuals. However, this term can be considered and used for those who make a living by writing application programs every day. Coders are often used for less experienced programmers and require minimal training. They usually lack knowledge of algorithms like programmers or developers, as well as being a term used for newcomers to the profession, and only know a single programming language such as C, Java, PHP,... Coders are often assigned simple code snippets by developers. In some cases, coders may also be referred to as "Junior Programmers" or "Junior Developers".`,
      `2. Programmer - 
      <img src="https://jobs.hybrid-technologies.vn/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/PROGRAMMER.png" alt="" width="300" height="300">

      If you have a clear problem but no clear solution, you need a <strong>Programmer</strong> to solve the problem and then code it. <strong>(Problem-solving + coding)</strong>.      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>Programmer</strong> They are slightly more specialized. They can create computer software in any basic programming language such as Java, Python, Lisp, etc. Programmers are considered to surpass Coders, as they can specialize in a particular field or even write guides for various types of systems.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Programmers also have a good understanding of algorithms. They are quite similar to Developers, but the main difference is that Programmers mainly implement systems, while Developers can design or build a good data structure within software. Additionally, Programmers will pay more attention to details.`,
      `3. Developer - 
      <img src="https://jobs.hybrid-technologies.vn/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DEVELOPER.png" alt="" width="300" height="300">

      If you feel you have a problem that needs solving but cannot define it clearly, you need a <strong>Developer</strong> to help you identify the problem first, then address it. <strong>(Analysis + Problem-solving + Coding)</strong>.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Developer – These individuals have a broad vision of the problem, with the ability to utilize various systems and programming languages, integrating them to solve the problem. They often don't just work with code but also with people, typically exhibiting good communication skills, problem reception, analysis, and solution development. They will then provide program designs as well as detailed descriptions for programmers and coders.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Therefore, we can summarize the basis for distinguishing these terms based on skills such as understanding of technology, engineering, design, algorithms, coding skills, etc. It can also be based on practical coding experience (which can be quantified by years, such as 1 year or 2 years, or by applications created), and it can also be based on each person's position within a company.`,

      `Best IDEs for programmers`,
      `1. Visual Studio - 
      The Visual Studio IDE is a Microsoft-powered integrated development interface developed to help software developers with web developments. The IDE uses artificial intelligence features to learn from the edit programmer’s make to their codes, making it easy for it to complete lines of code automatically.
      
      One of the top features many developers have come to like about Visual Studio is that it aids collaborative development between teams in live development. This feature is very crucial, especially during the debugging process. The IDE also allows users to share servers, comments and terminals.
      
      Visual Studio has the capability to support mobile app, web and game development. It also supports Python language, Node.js, ASP.NET and Azure. With Visual Studio, developers can easily create a development environment in the cloud.`,
      `2. IntelliJ IDEA - 
      IntelliJ Idea has been around for years and has served as one of the best IDEs for Java programming. The IntelliJ Idea UI is designed in a sleek way that makes coding appealing to many Java developers.
      
      With this IDE, code can get indexed, providing relevant suggestions to help complete code lines. It also takes this suggestive coding further by automating several tasks that may be repetitive.
      
      Apart from supporting web, enterprise, and mobile Java programming, it is also a good option for JavaScript, SQL and JPQL programming`,
      `3. Xcode - 
      Xcode might be the best IDE tool for Apple product developers. The tool supports iOS app development with its numerous iOS tools. The IDE supports programming languages such as Swift, C++ and Object-C.
      
      With XCode, developers can easily manage their software development workflow with quality code suggestions from the interface.`,
      `4. Android Studio - 
      The Android Studio is one of the best IDEs for Android app development. This IDE supports Kotlin and Java programming languages.
      
      Some important features users can get from the Android Studio are push alerts, camera integrations and other mobile technology features. Developers can also create variants and different APKs with the help of this flexible IDE, which also offers extended template support for Google Services.`,
      `5. AWS Cloud9 IDE - 
      The AWS Cloud9 IDE is packed with a terminal, a debugger and a code editor, and it supports popular programming languages such as Python and PHP.
      
      With Cloud9 IDE, software developers can work on their projects from almost anywhere in the globe as long as they have a computer that is connected to the internet, because it is cloud-based. Developers may create serverless applications using Cloud9 and easily collaborate with different teams in different development environments.`,

      `2. What are HTML tags? - 
      <br/>
      HTML tags are keywords used to format different structures on a web page. The syntax of an HTML tag consists of two parts: the opening tag and the closing tag, enclosed in angle brackets with a forward slash (/) added before the tag name in the closing tag.
